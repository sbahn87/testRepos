I included both the Cypress and Postman tests on one repo and each is within it's own folder. I'm grateful to have been able to do this project as I was able to learn 
a few new things about Postman and will use that knowledge moving forward. 

Please find working examples of Postman tests and requests with global variables set to pass the deck_id to a subsequent request.
